# Help & Support

Resuminator is proudly a community driven software, which means that we build what our community tells us they want and they help us maintain the software with their open source contributions or feedback. 

We provide support for any of your queries through 3 mediums
1. **Discord #support (Recommended)** - The fastest method to get any query resolved is posting it in the #support channel of our [Discord community server](https://discord.resuminator.in).
2. **Social Media Handles** - If you are not a Discord user you can message us on any of our social handles (@resuminator, everywhere), we generally respond the same day.
3. **Email** - The classic way to reach out for any other queries. Email your query or proposal at [hello@resuminator.in](mailto:hello@resuminator.in)

We're a budding community of developers and designers.
