# Help & Support

Resuminator is proudly a community driven software, which means that we build what our community tells us they want and
they help us maintain the software with their open source contributions or feedback.

We provide support for any of your queries through 3 mediums

1. **Discord #support (Recommended)** - The fastest method to get any query resolved is posting it in the #support
 channel of our [Discord community server](https://discord.resuminator.in).

2. **In-App Chat (Recommended)** - If you face any issues while using Resuminator, feel free to use the in-app chat.
We are available from 10:00 AM IST to 8:30 PM IST. You can leave a message outside this time,
we will reach out to you the next business day.

3. **Social Media Handles** - If you are not a Discord user you can message us on any of our social handles
(@resuminator, everywhere), we generally respond the same day.
Follow us on Twitter for any updates [@resuminator](https://twitter.com/resuminator)

4. **Email** - The classic way to reach out for any other queries. Email your query or proposal at [hello@resuminator.in](mailto:hello@resuminator.in)
