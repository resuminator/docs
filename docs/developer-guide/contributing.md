# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks a lot for your interest in contributing to Resuminator!
It's because of developers and designers like you that
Resuminator thrives to become a better product for our community. âœ¨

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) website has a collection of resources for individuals,
communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project.
Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to three primary repositories of Resuminator which are
[resuminator/resuminator](https://github.com/resuminator/resuminator),
[resuminator/resuminator-server](https://github.com/resuminator/resuminator-server),
[resuminator/docs](https://github.com/resuminator/docs)
which are hosted in the [Resuminator Organization](https://github.com/resuminator/) on GitHub.
Although most of guidelines would be same across all qualifiying repositories and excepts would been mentioned properly.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes
to this document in a pull request.

  an [umbrella issue for docs](https://github.com/resuminator/resuminator/issues/99) where we are planning and working on
  all docs. You may adopt a doc piece there to work on.

  the community and consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.
