## Step 2

Each resume in Resuminator is created with a default name `Untitled<number>`

However you can change this to your liking so that you can identify your resumes easily later (and even duplicate them later).
To do this you need to

* Click on the resume name (here, `Untitled0`) to open the editing popup.
* Type in a name and select an icon for this resume.
* Profit! ðŸŽ‰ Now your resume has a new name and icon.
