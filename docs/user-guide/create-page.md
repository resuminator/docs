### Working with a section

The various sections are made with almost the same data input layout to familiarize
the user with Resuminator and make it easy to use.

- The description sub-section supports Rich-text editing and markdown.
  :::tip
  We support limited RTE and markdown functions like:

  - Bold (`⌘/ctrl` + `B`)
  - Italics (`⌘/ctrl` + `I`)
  - Bulleted List(start a bulleted list with `*` followed by letters)
  - Numbered List(start a Numbered list with `1.` followed by letters)
  - Left align
  - Justify

  :::

- You can change the order of your sub-section of a section (when in collapsed state)
  by dragging it above or below of other sub-sections in that section.

  - **For example**, here drag and drop is shown in contacts and it is updated in resume to left and right of each other

  - **Here**, in Education section(much like other sections beyond it) the order is
    reflected in the resume as shown in the resume input side.

### Education

> This section helps you add your recent degrees and education accomplishments.

Although this section is pretty self-explanatory when used in the product, here are some nuances to keep in mind -

- When entering your degree duration year, you can click on the present checkbox if it is still
  going, and it will display from the starting year to present
- If you have 100 in the max grade, then your marks will automatically convert to a percentage with its symbol.
- The description sub-section supports Rich-text editing and markdown.
- You can hide the entire Education section from your resume or a particular degree by toggling its visibility icon.
- You can change the order of your degrees (when in collapsed state) by dragging it.
