## How can I participate?

First of all we are super glad to see your interest in participating in this year's Hacktoberfest with us.
We have different levels of issues and multiple ways of contributing to our codebase.

:::info
If you have never used Resuminator before, we would **highly recommend**
[creating a new account](https://www.resuminator.in/signup) on Resuminator and trying it out before you contribute.

We would only accept contributions from developer who have an account on Resuminator.
:::

We accept code contributions on mainly three repositories

- [resuminator](https://github.com/resuminator/resuminator) - The main web-app and website codebase.
- [resuminator-server](https://github.com/resuminator/resuminator-server) -
  The backend code which handles the data retrieval for the app.
- [docs](https://github.com/resuminator/docs) - Documentation and Wiki for Resuminator and its products
  (The line you are reading comes from this codebase)

:::note
For a quick overview of **tech stack** - we use React, Next JS, TypeScript, Node JS and MongoDB along with other
packages which you may read about [here](/docs/developer-guide/tech-stack)

## Understanding Issue Levels

We have different labels on our issues that signify what is the issue related to.
For Hacktoberfest you need to contribute to issues with the Hacktoberfest label and then select the issues
according to the difficulty

| Level   | Description                                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1 | Easy issues, minor typo fixes, documentation lines etc. **(reserved for beginners)**    |
| Level 2 | Patches - which do not require you to understand the codebase                           |
| Level 3 | Bug Fixes for some modules of the app                                                   |
| Level 4 | Adding new feature or functionality to existing code (frontend, website, backend, docs) |
| Level 5 | Designing and developing a new feature/functionality along with documentation           |

## Getting Started

:::info

### Pre-requisites

‚úÖ You must have a Resuminator account  
‚úÖ You have set up the front-end and backend with the required components  
‚úÖ You have read the Contribution Guide  
‚úÖ You have some prior knowledge of some part of our tech stack (for Level 3+ issues)  
:::

Now the main challenges which you might face while starting could be -

1. **Setting up a development environment.**

Setting up a local environment could be a little challenging at the start, but at the same time we'd argue that
it's a one-time thing. Follow the steps in a systematic order in our
[Development Setup guide](/docs/developer-guide/setting-up) to get your local
instance of Resuminator running to start making contributions.

1. **Getting familiar with the codebase.**

Every developer has a different way of reading though the codebase, but if you are new to this you can go through our
Reading the Codebase guide to get familiar with our codebase.
It will help you develop a mental model to navigate through enormous codebases and not get lost between the lines.

## Adding new issues

You can also play you part in contributing to our codebase by opening good issues which you faced while using Resuminator
Refer to this guide on [Reporting Bugs](/docs/developer-guide/contributing#reporting-bugs) to know more about the same.

We really appreciate high-quality bug reports and respect the developers who submit them. You can be one of such developers
by reading this guide on [Submitting Good Bug Reports](/docs/developer-guide/contributing#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report)
