# Hacktoberfest 2021

Resuminator is participating in [Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/),
hosted by DigitalOcean for the 8th year in a row. ü•≥

We invite all developers and designers to contribute to Resuminator this October 2021 by opening new
[issues](https://github.com/resuminator/resuminator/issues),
sharing your thoughts in our [discussions](https://github.com/resuminator/resuminator/discussions),
or by submitting a pull request (PR) against any [Hacktoberfest labeled issue]
(<https://github.com/resuminator/resuminator/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AHacktoberfest>) üôåüèª

## How can I participate?

First of all we are super glad to see your interest in participating in this year's Hacktoberfest with us.

* If you are a **beginner** with little knowledge of open-source contributions,
jump to the [Contributing as a Beginner](#contribute-as-a-beginner) section.
* If you have participated in previous year's Hacktoberfest, you may know the challenge rules,
start by reading the [Intermediate Contribution](#intermediate-contributions) section
* If you believe you are a Pro with open-source contributions and are very well versed with our whole
[tech-stack](/docs/developer-guide/tech-stack), jump to the [Pro Contributions](#pro-contributions) section

:::info
If you have never used Resuminator before, we would **highly recommend**
[creating a new account](https://www.resuminator.in/signup) on Resuminator and trying it out before you contribute.

We would only accept contributions from developer who have an account on Resuminator.

## Contribute as a Beginner

We really appreciate your interest to contribute to Resuminator. We accept code contributions on mainly three repositories

* [resuminator](https://github.com/resuminator/resuminator) - The main web-app and website codebase.
* [resuminator-server](https://github.com/resuminator/resuminator-server) -
The backend code which handles the data retrieval for the app.
* [docs](https://github.com/resuminator/docs) - Documentation and Wiki for Resuminator and its products
(The line you are reading comes from this codebase)

:::note
For a quick overview of **tech stack** - we use React, Next JS, TypeScript, Node JS and MongoDB along with other
packages which you may read about [here](/docs/developer-guide/tech-stack)
:::

Now the main challenges which you might face while starting could be -

1. **Setting up a development environment.**

Setting up a local environment could be a little challenging at the start, but at the same time we'd argue that
it's a one-time thing. Follow the steps in a systematic order in our Development Setup guide to get your local
instance of Resuminator running to start making contributions.

1. **Getting familiar with the codebase.**

Every developer has a different way of reading though the codebase, but if you are new to this you can go through our
Reading the Codebase guide to get familiar with our codebase.
It will help you develop a mental model to navigate through enormous codebases and not get lost between the lines.
